## 📖 **Once upon a time, in a Caribbean island…**

I’m Ronald, 19, and while most of my classmates were learning control systems theory, I was teaching myself to build full‑stack apps with **2+ years of daily, stubborn practice**. Why? Because I wanted to create, debug, and eventually work on **systems that actually help people** — and maybe escape the heat with a remote job that lets me live wherever I want.

This portfolio is **not** just another “look at my projects” page. It’s the bridge between my two worlds:  
**Automation Engineering** (root cause analysis, systems thinking) and **Software Development** (building, breaking, fixing).  

Every component, every animation, every metric is there to prove one thing:  
> *I don’t just write code — I solve problems.*  

Oh, and I play chess, I survived the Cambridge CAE with a **193/210**, and I built this entire site during Cuban blackouts. Resilience is not a buzzword here. 🇨🇺⚡

## 🧰 **The Toolbox** (aka Tech Stack)

This whole thing runs on a carefully crafted stack — nothing overkill, just the good stuff:

| Area               | Technologies                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Framework**      | Next.js 14 (App Router) · TypeScript · React 18                                              |
| **Styling**        | Tailwind CSS · Custom `navy`/`aws-orange` palette · Responsive from the ground up             |
| **Animations**     | Framer Motion · `whileInView` triggers · Smooth as butter                                     |
| **Icons**          | React Icons (Feather)                                                                         |
| **Deployment**     | Vercel · Edge Network · Automatic CI/CD                                                      |
| **Code Quality**   | ESLint · Prettier · TypeScript strict mode                                                   |

## ✨ **What makes this site different?**

- **♟️ Chess‑inspired 404 page** – because a wrong move is just a new position to troubleshoot.  
- **📊 Real metrics** – I don’t say “optimised queries”. I say “**60% faster API responses**”.  
- **🎓 Downloadable certificates** – no “verify this link” games. You want proof? Here’s the PDF.  
- **🧠 Human section** – yes, I watch anime and play volleyball. Deal with it.  
- **💼 CV download in two places** – for recruiters in a hurry.  

Everything is built with **progressive enhancement**, **accessibility** in mind, and a touch of Caribbean colour.
